## Description

etherguild.xyz is web app that incentivizes supporting ETH in a way that is both fun and rewarding. The website introduces Guild Quests: an opportunity for the community to signal initiative support through fine-grained, direct funding while achieving shared goals. Quest contracts allow individual funding per initiative with permissions held by a community Guild Officer multisig.

Our AI Agent Ethan has read/write access to the chain and the web API to funnel quest ideas and updates from the discord to the dashboard.

## How it's made

For ETH Global, we built a prototype Quest platform with three main components:

- etherguild.xyz - A Next.js app to visualize quests, store data, and track progress. We used onchainkit.xyz for the funding flow
- @ETHan - an discord + onchain agent that can create and modify quests based on discussion and ideas from guild members.
- etherguild-protocol - A set of contracts that enable anonymous donations while meeting non-profit legal requirements.
