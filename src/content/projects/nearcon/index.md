Calimocho Attestation Service free, open-source service empowering DAOs to standardize digital trust through secure, collective signature verification, optimizing governance and decision-making processes.

## Inspiration

Imagine a world where digital trust is as commonplace and reliable as a handshake between lifelong friends. This is the inspiration behind Calimocho Attestation Service. DAO coordination is currently fraught with challenges, especially when it comes to signing documents and reaching a consensus. Our goal was to simplify this process, making it not only easier but inherently more trustworthy.

## What it does

Calimocho Attestation Service streamlines the process for DAOs to collectively sign documents. It fosters coordination and consensus by allowing multiple members to sign off on documents. A quorum threshold ensures that decisions are made with sufficient agreement, thereby reinforcing the integrity of the DAO's operations.

## How we built it

The service was crafted through the development of a smart contract in conjunction with Ethereum's attestation service, leveraging components on BOS for a seamless and secure user experience. The architecture is designed to support a proposer and document signers, creating an efficient system for attesting documents.

## Challenges we ran into

The path was not without its hurdles. Ensuring secure integration of wallet connections, achieving consensus on the quorum threshold, and deploying a user-friendly frontend on BOS were among the challenges we tackled.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of our architectural framework, which has been meticulously developed to support proposers and document signers. The successful deployment of our smart contract and integration of wallet connectivity stand as testaments to our team's dedication and skill.

## What we learned

Throughout this journey, we've learned valuable lessons on deploying a frontend on BOS, intricacies of smart contract development, and the critical importance of DAO coordination. Each step has brought new insights into creating a robust platform for decentralized governance.

## What's next for Calimocho Attestation Service

The future is bright with plans to integrate Calimero private shard, which promises to enhance our service. This step forward will bring us closer to realizing a world where trust in the DAO space is as solid as the code upon which it runs.
