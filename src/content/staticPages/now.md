For the past 1.5 years, I was getting into web3 by working mostly as devops and blockchain automation tooling engineer for [blockscape.network](https://blockscape.network) and diving there into Kubernetes, Go & Rust and doing a lot of hackathons in my spare time.

Now, I wanted to dedicate some time to get into AI Agent development (mostly with [langchain](https://www.langchain.com/) and libraries built on top of it) and learn about the basics of ZK (through [0xparc](https://learn.0xparc.org)) both of which will have massive impact in the following years imo.

So ideally all those skills can be brought together at some point which I try to do with [datalatte.com](https://datalatte.com) where we try to help you find the right people to meet at any conference. The underlying tech is blockchain (ownership) and llms (data extraction / summarization / natural language interfaces for data queries).

I am currently looking for freelancing work to establish a more independent way of living.

Over the German winter, I am back in Thailand to escape cold, grayish and rainy weather and stay more productive around happy people.
